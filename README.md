ntroduction: 

The purpose of this study is to confirm if there is a relationship between the age someone has consumed their first alcoholic beverage and their gender. 
Given the extensive evidence for a greater probability in alcoholism within males (National Institute of Health, 2006), the hypothesis for this study is that the mean age for a first alcoholic beverage consumption will be lower for males than for females. 
This analysis could benefit alcohol prevention by providing a statistic specific to gender. 

Having hypothesized that , on average, males have their first drink at an earlier age, we can provide evidence for a need to redirect alcohol prevention measures with an emphasis on males. 
Furthermore, the statistics provide insight into the average female drinking ages, giving future researchers access to mean drinking ages for females for further study. 
In the future, this study can provide prevention against cognitive decline, reckless sexual activity, and general physical health.
